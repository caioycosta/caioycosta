- 👋 Hi, I’m @caioycosta
- 👀 I’m interested in hardcore computing - low level, hand-crafted algorithms, not using 157 different frameworks to do simple things, no shenanigans
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to live on the real world so this projects are a bit abandoned rn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything! Love solving problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: on ig, the same username as github, and on email, [mygithubusername]@(notcold)mail.com
